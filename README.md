#  QRCodeGenerator

Initially based on code from Appcoda article [Building a QR Code Generator with Core Image Filters](https://www.appcoda.com/qr-code-generator-tutorial).

Extracted and refined QRCode generation and manipulation into struct QRCodeGenerator.
Added controls to ViewController to manipulate text entry, size, redundancy, url encode or not, mode (.blackOnWhite, .whiteOnClear, .clearOnWhite).
